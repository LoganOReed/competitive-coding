# Workflow
Uses [cphelper.nvim](https://github.com/p00f/cphelper.nvim/tree/main) and the "Competitive Companion" Firefox extension.

To do a problem:
1. run :CphRecieve and then go to problem webpage and click on competitive companion to pull it into nvim.
2. use :CphEdit (test #) to edit test input/output
3. run :CphTest and :CphRetest to test code (C++) on tests
